The Dad Jokes App pulls random jokes and allows the user to rate them.
Ratings can range from 1 to 5, and the rate changes are shown by the change of emoji.
A loader appears while the app is fetching new jokes.

This project was built using Create React App, and uses the Dad Jokes API to illustrate the use of react lifecycle methods.
The Dad Jokes API is available at: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke
